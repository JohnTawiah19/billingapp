### An application that geerates an invoice from a timesheet given

This application is a basic CRUD application that takes the details of an employee and generates a invoice for a
project being worked on. The application is built on the ruby on rails framework. A later version would contain a limited number of companies which can be increased and reduced by the finance team.

### To run this application install rails framework

- run bundle to install the necessary gems
  run the rails server "rails s"

### Design assumptions

Initial plan was to create a relational database with the timesheet and the project as a relation. An employee fill a form that populates the database
The data is then fetched and used to generate an invoice. And I would love to get feedback on what I did wrong and how to improve the application better.


### This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
